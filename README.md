# CS174A_Project
Final Project for CS174A (Cube Runner)

Changes added this push:
1. Make the light follow the player rather than stay at the origin
2. Make autogenerated cubes get random init value within field of view of player (so that you can't just move really far to the side and avoid all obstacles)
3. Added initial funnel shape. Can be extended if we want to make the funnel appear every so often or make it an hourglass shape etc.
4. Added some textures to the obstacles
5. Made game screen bigger
6. Make scorecard full screen width (this will render differently on different machines, so I went with a size that's relatively small in case the computer we present on has a weird resolution)

Changes yet to be implemented/considered:
1. Special Features (I like the whole depth-based fading idea, so I might just go with that--or maybe even some kind of parallax scrolling?). 
2. Adjust textures of cubes/player (maybe mess with the diffusivity. I was trying to make it a little harder like the lights are off and you can only see in front of you, but you can adjust if you have a better idea)
3. Add a jpg background
