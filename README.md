# CS174A_Project
Final Project for CS174A (Cube Runner)

Changes added:
1. Collision Detection + Game state logic
2. Obstacle Culling
3. Smoother Movement 
4. Time-based scorecard.

It should be fully playable at this point; give it a try and let me know if everything feels alright. 
Changes yet to be implemented/considered:
1. Special Features (I like the whole depth-based fading idea, so I might just go with that--or maybe even some kind of parallax scrolling?). 
2. Make it look better (The original version has walls, and in general feels more structured than the randomly dispersed cube-fields we're generating).
